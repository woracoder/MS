Dear Recruiting Manager,

This letter is regarding my interest in applying for current intern openings in your organization for current graduate students. I am currently pursuing my Master of Science, Computer Science at University at Buffalo, The State University of New York and will graduate in December 2014.

I have a good academic record and 3.5 years of work experience as a Java/J2EE software developer. My role as a Senior Software Engineer at Accenture required me to develop enterprise multi-tier, load balanced and multi-threaded web applications using Java/J2EE technologies. I have worked on several projects during my tenure at Accenture which has provided me a lot of exposure to different client and server side web technologies. Working in a challenging and demanding client facing role and having been involved in the entire software development lifecycle of several projects has honed my programming as well as work and time management skills.

I have experience in working with Java, C and C++ languages and several client and server side technologies. My programming and problem solving skills were further improved by my coursework during the Fall 2013 semester which included Algorithms, Operating Systems, Information Retrieval and Software Engineering. My coursework for Spring 2014 semester includes Computer Networks, Distributed Systems, and Large Scale Distributed File Systems which will further add depth to my technical skills as well as my knowledge. Introduction to Android platform in Distributed Systems will add mobile application development skills to my repertoire.

In addition to my computer science knowledge and work experience, I have excellent interpersonal, written and verbal communication skills. I am willing and open to learning new things, enthusiastic, dedicated and motivated to perform all my assigned tasks sincerely. My prior work experience both as part of a team and being a good team player and working individually on projects will prove useful and provide you the best of services as required for the internship position.
 
I look forward to hearing from you so that we discuss about this opportunity further. Please feel comfortable to call me anytime for any clarifications or discussion. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Sudarshan Rao.
